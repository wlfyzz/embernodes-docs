### 7. Configure Geyser and Floodgate

1. After starting the server, go to the **File Manager** tab again.
2. Navigate to the `plugins/Geyser-Spigot` folder.
3. Open the `config.yml` file and configure the following settings:

   - **bedrock-address**: Set this to `0.0.0.0` to allow the proxy to listen for Bedrock connections on all interfaces.
   - **bedrock-port**: Default is `19132`. You can change this if needed.
   - **remote**:
     - **address**: Set this to `127.0.0.1` (your Java server's IP).
     - **port**: Ensure this is set to your server’s Java port, usually `25565`.
   - **auth-type**: Set to `floodgate` if Floodgate is installed, or `online` for Java account authentication.

4. Save the file after making your changes.

### 8. Restart Your Server

After configuration, restart your server by pressing the "Restart" button.

### 9. Check Geyser Status

Once the server is running, Bedrock players should now be able to connect to your server using your server's IP and the Bedrock port you set (default: `19132`).
