A comprehensive guide to allowing users to access your server

## Introduction

This guide will help you allow users to access your server on the [EmberNodes Panel](https://panel.embernodes.com).

## Prerequisites

- An account on the [EmberNodes Panel](https://panel.embernodes.com).
- A server on the [EmberNodes Panel](https://panel.embernodes.com)

## Disclaimer

### Never share your password with others, ALWAYS use subusers.

## Steps to adding subusers

### 1. Log in to the EmberNodes Billing Panel

1. Open your web browser and go to [billing.embernodes.com](https://billing.embernodes.com).
2. Log in with your EmberNodes Billing Panel credentials.

### 2. Navigate to Your Server

1. From the EmberNodes Panel dashboard, select the Minecraft server you want to configure.
2. Click on the eye icon of your server to manage its properties.

### 3. Navigate to the "Users" tab

1. Find the "Users" tab, this is usually the second to last spot.
2. On the "Users" tab, find the "New user" button.
3. Enter the email of the user you want to share access to.
4. Select all the permissions you think the user should have. We highly recommend not giving all permissions or highly permissive permissions unless you know what you are doing.
5. Once done with that, find the "Invite User" button at the top right and click it to ivnite the user.
6. The user will now be emailed if they do not have an account. Otherwise it will automatically appear on the [EmberNodes Panel](https://panel.embernodes.com) for them.

:::note

#### If the user you are sharing doesn't recive a password setup or they lost their password, they can get a new one at the [EmberNodes Panel Password Reset](https://panel.embernodes.com/auth/password) page.

## Conclusion

By adding subusers, you can allow full access, or customized access to other users on your server without giving your password to them.
